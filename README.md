# Haxornite2D
The old cancelled game Haxornite finally releases in 2D! (Web)

# Where can I play

Currently, Haxornite.xyz is down. Here's a mirror of the game:

# Important info
Sadly, Haxornite 2 is no longer in development. You will still be able to play the original 2D game on the site.

# What's next for Haxornite?
Haxornite 3 will be using Unity 2019 and will have online play, a thing that was envisioned from the project's very beginning. There were time constraints and limitations set by our PC specs at the time in the first 2 games.

After seeing how slow Haxornite 1 was, I thought that our next big game would need an ingame graphics slider and options that allow you to disable shadows, decrease model detail, etc.
